        <h1>Key Skills</h1>
        <div id = "skills"> 
            <h2>Adaptable</h2> 
            <p class = "adaptable">I am able to quickly adapt to any environment. I can show this through my NHS work experience within the 
               catering department. I was required to adapt to the fast-paced system that runs the catering department as everything had to be on time to ensure that the whole
               process ran smoothly.
            </p>
            <h2>Flexible</h2>
            <p class = "flexible">
            During group work I can efficiently work around everyones timetables and their other commitments to allow us to work together as a group to complete 
            the task that has been set, efficiently and effectively. i have shown this throught the NHS Cutlers Ambassador program.
            At the end if the program we were require to make  a presentation as a team, this thorugh us working together as a team and 
            making sure we all did our sections and represented back to the group so everyone knew what was going on.
            </p>
            <h2>Punctual</h2>
            <p class = "punctual">
                Throughout both of my work experiences I was required to be punctual and on time which I maintained throughout my time at my work experiences there 
                this was to ensure that I looked professional and shows to the people I work for that I am dedicated to what I am doing. Being on time ensured I was not fired
                from my placement and that my employers could trust me,
            </p>
            <h2>Reliability</h2>
            <p class = "reliability">
                Throughout my NHS work experience I had to be reliable as working within a hospital meant that pateints confidentiality could not be breached. Working in an environment were 
                confidentiality is key requires you to be trustworthy and reliable. Also the tasks I was given to complete meant I had to be reliable enough to get the tasks done on 
                time and with good efficieny.

                As I am in my first year of my degree, I am currently studying programming languages such as C++ in my module called Fundamental of Programming for Software Engineering, 
                C# in my module called Component Programming and HTML in my module called Professional Experience and Project Development. I am proficient
                in the use of Microsoft Office (Word, Powerpoint .etc). I have used online IDEs such as repl.it which is an online coding platform to quickly test out pieces of code. 
                Trello is another platfrom which I have used to help me organise and prioritise my pieces of work throughout my first year at university.
